# SICToolbox: Engineering

Resource toolbox to raise engineering students' awareness about sustainability challenges.

## Aim and scope

Raising awareness about the impact of ICT on the environment, can help shaping more sustainable solutions.

To be beneficial on a broad scale, this **awareness should be brought to all ages and levels of the population**.
Sustainable behaviour should not be forced on people, but we can provide the necessary tools and knowledge to achieve consciousness of our society's impact on the environment.
 
As engineers and computer scientists from the academic world, we developed an open-source, cooperative collections of tools and hints to enable bringing this awareness into the ICT fields.

The **SICT Interdisciplinary Cooperative Toolbox** is designed to help teaching staff to enrich their teaching portfolio with resources including and addressing sustainability aspects that are often overlooked.

The included content spans from graphs and real-world data about the impact of ICT on the environment passing through exercises involving the students,
to debates and event ideas for a broader public.

## Ideas for didactic material to raise awareness among students.

- List chemicals and ask them which they think is actually used in producing the components they used in the labs.
They could then raise the question about alternatives, which would need to be investigated.
Another question could thus be: Is it sustainable to use actual components rather than just simulating everything.

- Sustainability is not just production an environment, what about longevity and support?
Defend the case for open source hardware, in particular for microprocessor architectures.

- SIMD is more efficient, but is it always more sustainable? Do the sub-circuits implementing those instructions more energy-efficient?

- LCA of a discrete transistor vs. logic gate IC. We gain space by going toward smaller ICs, but are they more sustainable?
One of the first answers is *repairability*. Discrete components can be replaced individually, whilst integrated circuits form a whole as a design.
FPGA vs ASIC for different kind of applications.

## Metrics Assessing Material Effectiveness
In order to make sure awareness is raised, a performance assessment is essential.

Here are some rough ideas about some ways to go:
- Polls before and after the activity. Check the effect of the activity on the opinion or knowledge of learners.
Note that polls could be used to challenge the learners preconceptions (e.g. challenging preconceptions about rebound effect: "The energy consumption is growing exponentially, how would you change that?")
- Sustainability *Caf√©*. Organising events to share drinks and talk about changing the world, which popularity could reflect the effectiveness of activities.
- Student projects choices. More students choosing sustainable projects might be a sign of awareness spreading.

## Strategies for material implementation
The material made available on this repository can be used in several ways, following the objective of the teacher.

- During practical sessions such as **labs**. Learners can then have a hands-on experience of sustainability management. e.g. They are given a situation to analyse with resource to conduct their research, but they explore the subject by themselves.
- Teaching **beforehand**, transmitting key insights about sustainability in general, giving the opportunity to learners to have a new perspective on their work.
- Questioning results **afterwards**. Letting learners conduct their work as usual using *regular* material (i.e. not sustainable-aware), and only then organising an activity having them reflect back on their result or methodology.
- **Gamification**. Using a platform hosting game-like mechanics (Kahoot, Wooclap) or directly implementing them on the school LMS (achievements, progression tracking, badges, titles, leaderboards, scores).
